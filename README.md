# What is a TFG

The Degree Final Project (TFG in Spanish) consists of the student undertaking an autonomous project under the direction of a tutor, the completion of which is intended to help the students implement the skills that they have gained during their studies and ensure that they acquire the relevant competences associated with their degree.

Each degree has a Final Project Committee that aims, in part, to prepare the necessary guidelines for the organisation and development of this area.

# Aim of this Project

This main purpose of this project is to develop a Descentralized Exchange (DEX) using the Ethereum platform.
This DEX will allow users to exchange ERC20 tokens and Ether in a descentralized manner.
